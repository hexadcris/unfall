Introduction
============

In the following pages, we will provide a comprehensive explanation of the process for generating simulations in an effective manner.

We primarily operate within an efficient order on a positive trajectory, although this approach allows for some degree of flexibility.

System Requirements
===================

To run opGUI, it's essential to utilize the Google Chrome browser (with additional browsers being integrated in the future). The prerequisites for the successful execution of opGUI closely resemble those for openPASS.

PRE screen
==========

To configure the PRE window, in the next pages we will provide an explanation for generating the required data.

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   pre/*

RUN screen
==========

To configure the RUN window, in the next pages we will provide an explanation for generating the required data.
