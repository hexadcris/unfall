*
* \brief Collision component that calculates post-crash dynamics.
*
* The algorithms for collision detection and calculation of the post-crash dynamics are based
* on algorithms provided by Harald Kolk (TU Graz).
*
* The algorithm for collision dection is based on the Sutherlandâ€“Hodgman algorithm for
* polygon clipping.
*
* The algorithm for calculating the post-crash-dynamics is based on conservation of momentum
* and angular momentum. It works in 2D and is only valid for non-sliding collisions.
*
* Note that this module is provisional regarding several aspect. openPASS needs to be
* changed in order to improve the following:
* - The post-crash dynamics is currently only calculated and written to the log-file since
*   openPASS does not allow to forward the results to dynamic-components and
*   observation modules, currently.
* - This module needs several parameters (coeffRest, interFriction and timeOfPenetration).
*   openPASS currently does not allow to set parameters for this module in the config files.
*   Therefore, these parameters are hard-coded.
* - The calculation of the post-crash dynamics is based on the assumptions that the time
*   where the collision starts is known since the post-crash dynamics shall be calculated a
*   certain time ( given by the parameter timeOfPenetration ) after the first contact of the
*   vehicles.
*   Currently, this module does not know anything about sample rates etc. which makes it
*   difficult to find the correct time to calculate the post-crash dynamics.
* - The algorithm for the post-crash dynamics uses the pre-crash yaw velocities of both agents.
*   Since the yaw velocity is not available for the agents currently, the yaw velocities are
*   set to zero here.
*
* Note:
* - The method GetVertexTypes in collisionDetection assumes that the intersection of the two vehicles is rather small.
*   It has not been checked if the method covers all possible cases for bigger intersections which
*   are possible in openPASS depending on the cycle times.
